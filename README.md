# Technology Department Onboarding Session and Intro to Git

Welcome to the Tech Department onboarding Git session!  
Each participant will add their own profile as a JSON file in the `src/members/` folder.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Clone** your fork.
3. **Create a branch** (suggested: `add-<lastname>-profile`).
4. **Add your JSON file** in the `src/members/` directory, named as `<lastname>.json`.
5. **Commit** and **push** your changes.
6. **Open a pull request** to merge your branch.

### JSON File Example

Place your file in `src/members/<lastname>.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice Example",
  "age": 22,
  "position": "Frontend Developer",
  "department": "Web Development",
  "reason": " I applied so that I can enhance my skills",
  "funFact": "I climbed Mount Fuji."
}
```

## Goal

- Forking
